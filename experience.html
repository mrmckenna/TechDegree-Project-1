            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I am currently in the process of earning my Front End Web Development Tech Degree from TreeHouse. I have
                been self-taught in the languages of HTML and CSS through various free online resources like
                <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. While I first took an
                interest in learning front end web development in 2016, I have only just now in 2020 enrolled in the
                TreeHouse program to take the necessary steps toward landing a career in the field of coding.

            <h2>Sales</h2>
            <p>I began working in sales in 2016, particularly in telecommunications. After 2 years, I decided that I
                wanted to pursue a career elsewhere. I enrolled in the pre-licensing course to obtain my real estate license. Upon 
                completing the course, I passed the final exam on my first attempt, which then began my journey that brought me to where 
                I am today. I am currently a licensed Realtor in the state of Michigan and a proud member of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
